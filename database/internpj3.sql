Not only does that enable Irving to play home games this, but it paves the way for him to feel good about re-signing with the Nets this offseason.\r\n\r\n“I think for me, it has always been about being comfortable, loving where I’m at, and I love it here,” said Irving. “Once that summertime hits, I know we’ll have some conversations. But there’s no way I can leave my man Number 7 anywhere.\"\r\n\r\nNumber 7 refers to Nets forward Kevin Durant. Irving and Durant famously decided to team up in Brooklyn in the 2019 offseason.

Together on Friday, they announced an agreement in principle on a new framework for transatlantic data flows.\r\n\r\nThis agreement is critical for tech companies including giants such as Google and Meta, which rely on being able to transfer data between Europe and the US in order to function properly. Back in February, Meta warned that if a new agreement wasn\'t reached, it may have no choice but to pull out of Europe, after the former pact, known as Privacy Shield, became defunct.\r\n\r\n\"With concern growing about the global internet fragmenting, this agreement will help keep people connected and services running,\" said Meta\'s President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said in a tweet on Friday. \"It will provide invaluable certainty for American & European companies of all sizes, including Meta, who rely on transferring data quickly and safely.\"\r\n\r\nBack in July 2020, Europe\'s top court ruled Privacy Shield invalid. Judges expressed concerns that Privacy Shield certification didn\'t adequately protect the data of European citizens from US surveillance activities in the same way they\'re protected in the EU. Essentially, there was no guarantee that privacy protections provided for by law within the EU can be upheld when people\'s data travels to the US.\r\n\r\nFollowing his inauguration, Biden immediately appointed a lead negotiator to work on reestablishing data flows between the US and EU. Data transfers have been allowed to continue while a new agreement is worked on, thanks to a mechanism known as standard contractual clauses. But even this process is at risk, due to a ruling by the Irish data protection agency in August 2020. A final decision on the legality of using standard contractual clauses for data transfers is due is the coming months.The agreement in principle may have arrived just in the nick of time, but it doesn\'t yet amount to a replacement for Privacy Shield. This will need to hammered out quickly in the months ahead, to ensure Meta and other companies relying on data flows to continue their operations.\r\n\r\nBiden and von der Leyen didn\'t share any details about the new deal on Friday, other than to say it safeguards privacy and civil liberties. \"This is another step in strengthening our partnership,\" said von der Leyen in a statement. \"We manage to balance security and the right to privacy and data protection.\" In the meantime, negotiations are likely ongoing behind the scenes to try and get a solid new agreement finalized before time runs out on standard contractual clauses.\r\n\r\nLawyer Max Schrems, who succeeded in the legal challenge against both Privacy Shield and its predecessor, the Safe Harbor agreement, said in a statement that a political announcement without solid text seemed to generate even more legal uncertainty in the meantime. Given that there seems to be no effort by the US to overhaul its surveillance laws, he added that he expected to also challenge any new agreement in court once it had been passed.\r\n\r\n\"It is regrettable that the EU and US have not used this situation to come to a \'no spy\' agreement, with baseline guarantees among like-minded democracies,\" he said. \"Customers and businesses face more years of legal uncertainty.\"', 4, 'biden.jpeg', '2022-03-27 00:00:00', '2022-03-27 23:12:37'),

(13, 'Which was better? Aaron Gordon in the NBA Dunk contest in 2016 or 2020?', 'The Orlando Magic’s Aaron Gordon may have the two best dunk contest ever for a runner up, but which dunk contest was better 2016 or 2020?\r\n\r\nAlmost everyone in the building looked shocked as the judges scored Aaron Gordon’s final dunk in Saturday’s AT&T Slam Dunk Contest. Mouths dropped to the floor from about everyone in Chicago — from Tacko Fall to Giannis Antetokounmpo.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the NBA world thought Aaron Gordon’s last dunk over Tacko Fall solidified him as the 2020 NBA Slam Dunk Contest winner. But once again, that was not the case.\r\n\r\nThe judges had scored Gordon’s final dunk a 47 — his only dunk of the six he performed that did not garner a perfect score of 50. That left him one point shy of Derrick Jones Jr., delivering the title to the high-flying Miami Heat forward and sparking conspiracy theories all around.\r\n\r\nThe final result and the feeling of emptiness left for Gordon and NBA fans quickly reminded people of the dreadful night at then-Air Canada Centre (now Scotiabank Arena) in Toronto back in 2016. Gordon put on another show and did incredible dunks that would stand the test of time and ultimately did not go home with the hardware.\r\n\r\nThat night in 2016, Gordon finished with one of the most iconic slam dunks ever in NBA history, as he jumped over the Magic’s mascot, STUFF, and went under both of his legs to throw down a monster dunk.It was the most mind-boggling and amazing thing many fans had seen. It was undoubtedly the best dunk of the competition.\r\n\r\nThe contest winner then-Minnesota Timberwolves (now Chicago Bulls) guard Zach LaVine believe that 2016 duel between himself and Aaron Gordon was the best dunk contest of all time, outshining Michael Jordan versus Dominique Wilkins in 1988.  Dominique Wilkins may not have agreed with that assessment but agreed there should have been two trophies given out to both contestants that night.\r\n\r\nThere were certainly two winners that night with two of the best dunkers in league history showing off their athleticism and creativity to the delight of all.\r\n\r\nIt takes nothing away from Lavine’s accomplishments, to end up winning the 2016 dunk contest after a performance from an opponent like Gordon is no easy feat. But nevertheless, many people from NBA circles and pundits from around the media thought Gordon should have won.\r\n\r\nFast forward to 2020 and Gordon ends up in a similar predicament, where the majority of fans thought the judges robbed him and he should have been the one who was hoisting up the trophy.\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury, Jones Jr. completed a similar dunk to what Lavine did in 2016 which gave him a very win controversial win — a windmill from the free-throw line. At least LaVine’s leap from the foul line was closer to its free-throw-line target rather than a few steps in like Jones.\r\n\r\nGordon certainly felt like he should have had two contest trophies in his possession as he officially announced his retirement from the contest.\r\n\r\nTo many, Gordon was the “People’s Champion” in both 2016 and 2020. He was the clear pick of those in attendance and fans around the Internet even if he did not take home the ultimate prize.\r\n\r\nGordon, along with Wilkins, are the only players to finish runner-up in two NBA Dunk Contests. And Gordon will cement himself as one of the best to ever do it — even without the trophy.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly too, Gordon’s 2016 and 2020 efforts are two of the very best performances in Dunk Contest history.\r\n\r\nBut which one of Gordon’s performances was better?\r\nIn a sense, it would be hard to top Gordon’s 2016 performance with STUFF, although his 2020 performance when he completed a one-handed 360 with Markelle Fultz throwing the basketball off the left side was iconic as well.\r\nThat seemed a natural evolution from Gordon’s one-handed 360 while grabbing the ball from STUFF spinning on a hoverboard.This year Gordon officially became the first dunker in NBA history to complete a two-handed dunk over a 7-foot-5 inch man. That dunk somehow earned Gordon a 47 from the judges.\r\n\r\nKenny Smith said it best on the TNT broadcast, if you can dunk over Tacko, you should win. The shock that this did not win the contest — arguably the contest’s most iconic dunk — is a bit appalling.\r\n\r\nGordon’s 2020 performance has to be better than the 2016 performance after putting up five straight 50’s on the scoreboard. Gordon looked like he was going to win the contest after every dunk he completed. But the agony of defeat felt different this year.\r\n\r\nMaybe because most people in NBA circles thought this was Gordon’s year to win it all, especially with LaVine electing to not participate in the 2020 NBA Dunk Contest. Or simply that every dunk Gordon performed seemed an evolution of what he did in 2016 without the props.', 1, 'AG_dunk.jpg', '2022-03-30 00:00:00', '2022-03-30 21:35:58'),
(14, 'Fight Of The Century (Million Dollors Fight)', 'Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao, billed as the Fight of the Century or the Battle for Greatness, was a professional boxing match between undefeated five-division world champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. and eight-division world champion Manny Pacquiao. It took place on May 2, 2015, at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Paradise, Nevada. Mayweather Jr. won the contest by unanimous decision, with two judges scoring it 116–112 and the other 118–110.Although the fight was considered to be one of the most anticipated sporting events in history, it was largely considered a letdown by critics and audiences alike upon its broadcast.\r\n\r\nDespite predictions that Mayweather–Pacquiao would be the highest-grossing fight in history as early as 2009, disagreements between the two professional boxers\' camps on terms for the fight prevented the bout from coming to fruition until 2015.The failure to arrange the Mayweather–Pacquiao fight was named the 2010 Event of the Year by The Ring. Serious negotiations were kickstarted in 2014 by an unlikely source: a Hollywood waiter and part-time actor, Gabriel Salvador,made a key introduction between Pacquiao\'s trainer and confidant Freddie Roach and CBS President Les Moonves, who both worked to facilitate the match. By 2015, negotiations for the fight had been finalized, with all of the major issues that prevented the fight from happening in the past resolved, including purse split, drug testing, and location.\r\n\r\nThe fight was televised through a pay-per-view (PPV) jointly produced by HBO and Showtime, the respective rightsholders of Pacquiao and Mayweather. In the Philippines, the fight was also broadcast in simulcast across three of the country\'s major broadcast television networks. The fight was expected to be the most lucrative in the history of professional boxing: with an initial estimate of 4.4 million purchases, the PPV alone broke revenue records in the United States (U.S.) with $410 million in revenue, making it the highest-grossing PPV in history, surpassing Mayweather–Álvarez in 2013. By September 2015, the figure had been amended to 4.6 million.The broadcast of the fight in the Philippines was watched by nearly half the country\'s households. Due to the record high price of the PPV, the fight was also widely broadcast through unauthorized online streams on services such as Periscope.\r\n\r\nDespite the large amount of hype that surrounded it, critics felt that the bout itself was disappointing, primarily citing Mayweather\'s defense-oriented strategy in the ring and Pacquiao\'s difficulty in landing punches on Mayweather. This had led to some critics re-labelling the fight \'Better Never Than Late\' rather than \'Fight of the Century\'.It was later revealed following the event that Pacquiao had sustained an undisclosed injury to his right shoulder while training and that while it had healed in time for the fight, he re-injured it during the fourth round. Further controversy emerged when it was revealed that prior to the fight, Mayweather had been administered IV fluids cleared by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) through a retroactive \"therapeutic use exemption\"—an exemption, however, not authorized by the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC).

(15, 'Why Do We Need Sleep?', 'Sleep is an essential function1 that allows your body and mind to recharge, leaving you refreshed and alert when you wake up. Healthy sleep also helps the body remain healthy and stave off diseases. Without enough sleep, the brain cannot function properly. This can impair your abilities2 to concentrate, think clearly, and process memories.\r\n\r\nMost adults require between seven and nine hours3 of nightly sleep. Children and teenagers need substantially more sleep, particularly if they are younger than five years of age. Work schedules, day-to-day stressors, a disruptive bedroom environment, and medical conditions can all prevent us from receiving enough sleep. A healthy diet and positive lifestyle habits can help ensure an adequate amount of sleep each night – but for some, chronic lack of sleep may be the first sign of a sleep disorder.\r\nThe Science Behind Sleep\r\n\r\nAn internal “body clock”4 regulates your sleep cycle, controlling when you feel tired and ready for bed or refreshed and alert. This clock operates on a 24-hour cycle known as the circadian rhythm. After waking up from sleep, you’ll become increasingly tired throughout the day. These feelings will peak in the evening leading up to bedtime.\r\n\r\nThis sleep drive – also known as sleep-wake homeostasis – may be linked to adenosine, an organic compound produced in the brain. Adenosine levels increase throughout the day as you become more tired, and then the body breaks down this compound during sleep.\r\n\r\nLight also influences the circadian rhythm. The brain contains a special region of nerve cells known as the hypothalamus, and a cluster of cells in the hypothalamus called the suprachiasmatic nucleus, which processes signals when the eyes are exposed to natural or artificial light. These signals help the brain determine whether it is day or night.\r\n\r\nAs natural light disappears in the evening, the body will release melatonin, a hormone that induces drowsiness. When the sun rises in the morning, the body will release the hormone known as cortisol that promotes energy and alertness.For most adults, at least seven hours of sleep7 each night is needed for proper cognitive and behavioral functions. An insufficient amount of sleep can lead to serious repercussions. Some studies have shown sleep deprivation leaves people vulnerable to attention lapses, reduced cognition, delayed reactions, and mood shifts.\r\n\r\nIt’s also been suggested that people can develop a sort of tolerance to chronic sleep deprivation. Even though their brains and bodies struggle due to lack of sleep, they may not be aware of their own deficiencies because less sleep feels normal to them. Additionally, lack of sleep has been linked to a higher risk for certain diseases and medical conditions. These include obesity, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, poor mental health, and early death.\r\n\r\nAdults who do not receive a sufficient amount of sleep each night can implement some positive lifestyle and sleep habits in order to log the needed seven to nine hours. These include the following:\r\n\r\n   - Establish a realistic bedtime and stick to it every night, even on the weekends.\r\n  - Maintain comfortable temperature settings and low light levels in your bedroom.\r\n    - Keep a comfortable sleep environment by ensuring you have the best mattress, best pillows, and best sheets for your sleep preferences and body type.\r\n    - Consider a “screen ban” on televisions, computers and tablets, cell phones, and other electronic devices in your bedroom.\r\n   -  Abstain from caffeine, alcohol, and large meals in the hours leading up to bedtime.\r\n    - Refrain from using tobacco at any time of day or night.\r\n    - Exercise during the day; this can help you wind down in the evening and prepare for sleep.\r\n', 2, 'sleeping.jpg', '2022-03-30 00:00:00', '2022-03-30 21:59:43'),

(17, 'BLACKPINK’s Rosé Stole the Show at Saint Laurent During Paris Fashion Week', 'BLACKPINK’s Rosé continues her total fashion domination. Just a few weeks after she made her historic debut at the 2021 Met Gala, she popped up in Paris to support her friends at Saint Laurent for their Spring/Summer 2022 show, which took place at the Eiffel Tower.\r\n\r\nAs noted by W, Rosé, who is a global brand ambassador for Saint Laurent, attended the event in an extremely chic LBD. She wore a sheer black chiffon minidress with silk trim over a pair of black hot pants; the thigh-skimming dress dangled from barely-there spaghetti straps. Rosé paired the daring-yet-romantic dress with a pair of super sheer black tights, classic black knee-high boots, and a gold chain choker studded with pearls. She wore her blonde hair tied back in a messy, chic knot with a few pieces falling out to frame her face. The look was simple but stunning in its sophistication.W notes that Rosé has been working with the brand since 2020, and she\'s become good friends with its creative director Anthony Vaccarello. “She is Saint Laurent in the way she lives, in the way she takes charge of how she dresses, in her way of liberating herself from the crowd,” he told W about the musician. “She’s someone who represents today’s society.”\r\nRosé and Vaccarello appeared together on the Met Gala carpet earlier in September, with Rosé wearing an \'80s-inspired black minidress with a big white bow. Rosé is not the only member of BLACKPINK to appear at Paris Fashion Week to support her favorite brands. Her bandmates Jennie, Lisa, and Jisoo have also done so in the present and past, as they are all paired up with some of the most famous French luxury fashion brands. Jennie works with Chanel and has posed for their campaigns, while Lisa has partnered with Celine. Jisoo works with Dior as their global brand ambassador and recently attended their Paris Fashion Week show in a Roman-inspired embroidered black and white minidress.\r\n\r\nAny BLINK knows that the four bandmates have exceptional style, and Paris Fashion Week is only bringing that to the forefront as Rosé and her friends show up in gorgeous look after gorgeous look.

(18, 'Elon Musk Sets New Target for First SpaceX Starship Orbital Flight', 'The biggest of the billionaire\'s rockets could launch before school lets out in North America.\r\nStarship might finally make it to space within the next few months -- or at least that\'s what SpaceX founder Elon Musk is currently shooting for. \r\n\r\nThe next-generation spacecraft is the vehicle NASA plans to use to send astronauts back to the surface of the moon, and Musk hopes it could put footprints on Mars by the end of the decade. \r\n\r\n\"First Starship orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 engines, as they are much more capable and reliable,\" Musk tweeted on Monday. \"We\'ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month, then another month to integrate, so hopefully May for orbital flight test.\"\r\n\r\nThe Raptor 2 is designed to be over 25% more powerful than its predecessor.\r\n\r\n    First Starship orbital flight will be with Raptor 2 engines, as they are much more capable & reliable. 230 ton or ~500k lb thrust at sea level.\r\n\r\n    We’ll have 39 flightworthy engines built by next month, then another month to integrate, so hopefully May for orbital flight test.\r\n    — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) March 21, 2022\r\n\r\nMusk previously expressed concern about SpaceX\'s pace of Raptor engine production, warning that bankruptcy could be possible if the company failed to increased its rate of engine manufacturing. \r\n\r\nThe CEO plans to use Starship to launch greater numbers of the company\'s Starlink broadband satellites at a time. Musk has said revenue from the global internet service is key to his greater ambition of sending Starship to Mars. \r\n\r\nThe switch to Raptor 2 engines also means the Super Heavy Booster and Starship prototypes that SpaceX has recently been testing at its Starbase development facility in Texas will likely not be the vehicles used for the first orbital mission. An updated booster and ship are expected to be rolled out to the test stand soon.\r\n\r\nOnce everything is ready, the plan is for Starship\'s first jaunt to space to involve blasting off from Starbase, making a trip to orbit and then coming in for a soft water landing off the coast of Hawaii. The booster is expected to return for a landing at an offshore landing pad in the Gulf of Mexico. \r\n\r\nEngine production isn\'t the only hurdle that must be cleared before liftoff. SpaceX also is still waiting on the Federal Aviation Administration to complete an environmental review and issue a launch license for the orbital test mission. The FAA has pushed back its planned release date for its final environmental assessment a few times and currently expects to have it ready for the public on March 28.\r\n\r\nThe assessment will essentially determine whether the Starship launch can move forward as soon as possible or if more time is required for a more involved environmental impact review that could take several more months or longer to complete. \r\nGet the CNET Now newsletter\r\nSpice up your small talk with the latest tech news, products and reviews.

However, when you buy something through our retail links, we may earn an affiliate commission.\r\n\r\nWe know why you\'re here. Joining the list of admirers for our favorite bad gal? Thought so. I mean, let\'s face it: Rihanna is the gift that keeps on giving when it comes to the looks she serves. Since the big announcement, we\'ve been completely enthralled with the pop star and her maternity styles, which her dream team (makeup artist Priscilla Ono, hairstylist Yusef Williams, and stylist Jahleel Weaver) manage to execute seamlessly. But what\'s new? \r\n\r\nIt\'s time we round up our favorites with a complete breakdown, including makeup alternatives to try out from our 2021 Best of Beauty winners if your favorite Fenty Beauty products are sold out. \r\n\r\nPink in the City\r\nFor the initial reveal with beaux A$AP Rocky, Miles Diggs (also known as Diggzy) captured exclusive photos that ran exclusively in People. These snaps showcased Rihanna\'s subtle makeup look. The fashions, of course, are provided: bubblegum pink archive Chanel, a Christian LaCroix gemstone necklace, and distressed boyfriend jeans. \r\n\r\nBut we’re completely zoned into Ono\'s makeup job. Rihanna\'s lip combination is the striking moment here. We assume it\'s courtesy of Fenty Beauty\'s Gloss Bomb in FU$$Y, which is a sweet shimmery pink, plus a touch of Killawatt Freestyle Highlighter. On February 7, Rihanna\'s lips were doused with Fenty Beauty\'s Icon Lipstick in \'Board Memb\'r\' by Ono, with assistance from Yvette Evora while out and about. (You can see Diggzy\'s photo of that moment here.) And then again on March 1, Rihanna\'s burgundy stained Cupid\'s bow presented itself again, which you can see for yourself in the photo above. \r\n\r\nDuring Paris Fashion Week, Ono and Agnese Rossetto kept things subtle again for a light and dewy beat. Rihanna was dressed prettily in all black, a lacy dress chosen by Weever with a half-up, half-down hairstyle of waves styled by Williams. The mother-to-be glowed at the hands of Ono assisted again by Evora for her launch event on February 11. Ono\'s standout products to achieve this look are definitely Fenty Beauty\'s \'Mocha\' and \'Truffle\' Match Stixs, and Cheeks Out Daiquiri Dip for blush. Although Rihanna\'s wearing her signature Killawatt in \'Mean Money\', and \'Hu$tla Baby\', another product to try is Patrick Ta Beauty\'s Major Sculpt Crème Contour & Powder Bronzer Duo, which gives a double effect in contouring and bronzing your skin. \r\n\r\n\r\nMost Popular\r\nKourtney Kardashian at the 2018 CFDA Fashion Awards. \r\nMAKEUP\r\nKourtney Kardashian\'s Jade Nails Defy Every Seasonal Manicure Rule\r\n\r\nBY SARA MIRANDA\r\n\r\nAnne Hathaway Global Premiere Apple TV+\'s \"WeCrashed\" Academy Museum of Motion Pictures Los Angeles, California\r\nMAKEUP\r\nAnne Hathaway Is Unrecognizable Under All That Avatar Makeup\r\n\r\nBY ADDISON ALOIAN\r\n\r\nthree women on black and white on a designed background\r\nWELLNESS\r\nYour April Horoscope Predictions Are Here\r\n\r\nBY SOPHIE SAINT THOMAS\r\n\r\nOno also used a black strip of eyeliner Flyliner \'Cuz I’m Black\' to crush on the eyes.
